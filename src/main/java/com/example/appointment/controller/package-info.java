/**
 * <p>This package implements the Controller of the Model-View-Controller design pattern for the appointment scheduler.
 * It has multiple controllers that control the functionality for all the different pages. This includes the MainController which
 * sets-up the main appointments page, the ViewCustomersController which displays customers, and all the other controllers this program uses.
 * This also includes multiple interfaces that separate some of the more complex functionalities from the controllers.
